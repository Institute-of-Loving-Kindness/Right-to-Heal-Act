# Right-to-Heal-Act

## THE RIGHT TO HEAL ACT
Purpose:  To Restore Americans’ 1st Amendment Right to Heal with natural psychedelic medicine as a means of promoting physical, mental, and spiritual healing.

### A BILL
The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says that everyone in the United States has the right to practice his or her own religion, or no religion at all.

This bill requires Federal Action to restore religious liberty under the 1st Amendment to ensure that spiritual organizations and healing centers have the right to serve psychedelic medicine as a means of promoting physical, mental, and spiritual healing. 

It also authorizes the Bureau of Indian Affairs to establish the Department of Natural Medicine (DNM). 

It also establishes a process for the Department of Natural Medicine (DNM) to offer these natural medicines as established healing therapies under the Affordable Care ACT (ACA) and be fully-subsidized by Health Insurnance Policies and the Veterans Administration (VA).

### Section 1: We Recognize Natural Medicine

Despite the documented continued use of traditional healing methods, modalities and its associated practitioners by Indigenous groups across North America, it is presumed that widespread knowledge is elusive amongst most Western trained health professionals and systems. 

This despite that the approximately 7.5 million Indigenous peoples who currently reside in Canada and the United States (US) are most often served by Western systems of medicine. A state of the literature is currently needed in this area to provide an accessible resource tool for medical practitioners, scholars, and communities to better understand Indigenous traditional medicine in the context of current clinical care delivery and future policy making.

The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) was a pivotal document for the world’s Indigenous Peoples. In addition to being quoted in numerous policy, research, and community initiatives since it was adopted, the declaration is now being used to evaluate the adequacy of national laws; for interpreting state obligations at the global level; and by some corporations, lending agencies, and investors in regards to resource and development opposition on Indigenous lands. 

Article 24 of the declaration states that “Indigenous peoples have the right to their traditional medicines and to maintain their health practices, including the conservation of their vital medicinal plants, animals, and minerals” (UN document A/RES/61/295). The World Trade Organization has stated that “traditional medicine contributes significantly to the health status of many communities and is increasingly used within certain communities in developed countries. Appropriate recognition of traditional medicine is an important element of national health policy”.

The United Nations Economic and Social Council President in 2009, Sylvie Lucas, stated that “[t]he potential of traditional medicine should be fostered. … ‘We cannot ignore the potential of traditional medicine’ in the race to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and renew primary health care for those who lacked access to it … traditional medicine [is] a field in which the knowledge and know-how of developing countries was ‘enormous’—and that was a source of hope for improving the world’s health-care situation”.

In November 2008, member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted the Beijing Declaration [5], where they recognized the role of traditional medicine in the improvement of public health and supported its integration into national health systems where appropriate. The declaration also promotes improved education, research, and clinical inquiry into traditional medicine, as well as improved communication among health-care providers.

### Section 2: We Recognize American's Right to Heal

The United States was founded on the principle of Freedom of Religion. That principle was not extended to Indigenous communities during the early establishment of the United States. Just as the United States once legalized slavery, fought a civil war over the concept and eventually outlawed the practice; the United States must correct it’s ongoing persecution of American citizens right to Freedom of Religion by abolishing the Government's involvement in Religion and the use of Natural Medicines as sacred sacraments.

We the People, hereby, recognizise and restore American's Right to Heal with Natural Medicines such as:
